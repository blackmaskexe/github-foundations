- when looking at an issue or pull request, you can add a notification subscription to that issue/pr to get updates on it's statuses 
- subscriptions can be seen @ github.com/notifications/subscriptions
- ==NOTE: This is different from watching, as watching is for repos and people, but notifications is for specific purposes like issues / prs @ github.com/watching ==
- NOTE: You are automatically subscribed to issues & PRs that you create
- you also are automatically watching for your own reops
