- for personal accounts, you can have a public GitHub user profile to showcase yourself as a developer

## Features:
- profile picture and bio
- user profile readme (a readme file rendered on your profile)
- achievements (for doing goofy things)
- repositories (showcase, including an option to pin 6 repos and gists)
- contribution graph
	  - graph displaying your contributions over the past year
	  - activity includes commits, prs, issues, code reviews
	  - by default, only public contributions are displayed in this graph, but can also include to add private contributions (actual activity remains private), 
	  - displays green boxes of varying opacity based on your activity on the particular day
	  - nerdy note: If you want your profile contribution graph to have high opacity, prevent contributing too much in one day as opacity is calculated by contributions today / max number of contributions you have done (in this year i think). but you do you I just want my github profile to look pretty
- followers and following
- stars (shows repos you have starred)
- organizations (list of github orgs you are a part of)
- contribution activity (detailed list of recent activities on GitHub)

TODO in my own profile: use gists to explain what each pinned repo does (essentially making it top 3 repos on display, but explain each one in detail-ish)

## Profile Readme:
- create a repo with the same name as your username, and have a readme inside of it
- this readme will be displayed on your github profile
- this is a link to my [profile readme](https://github.com/blackmaskexe/blackmaskexe)
