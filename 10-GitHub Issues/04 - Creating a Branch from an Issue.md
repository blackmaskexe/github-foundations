You can either: (both lead to the same result)
- create a branch or an issue
- associate an issue with a branch

## Issue Associated Branch Naming Convention:
- if your issue #6 is "forgot to return in a function", your branch should be named "6-forgot-to-return-in-a-function" (or a shorter but identifiable name similar to this)

## How to create a branch from an issue:
- under the development option of creating an issue, select "Create a branch"
- it's as easy as that
