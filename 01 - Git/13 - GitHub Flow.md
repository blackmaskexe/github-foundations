- lightweight workflow for multiple devs working on a single repo
- it's not a tool or something, the process of working with remote repos in a particular way is called the GitHub flow, and is as follows:

## Steps of GitHub Flow:
- create a branch for each new task / feature
- add commits to your branch
- open pull requests, discussing about your commits and reviewing code changes in the pull request
- share your pull request with teammates for feedback
- deploy & test your changes in a test environment
- once testing is done, merge it into the main / production branch
