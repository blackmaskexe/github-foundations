- When you create a branch in Git, you are copying all the code files from the main branch to the newly created branch
  - the main branch can be thought of as the trunk of a tree, where all code was worked on at the start of the repo creation
- You can have as many branches in your codebase as you want

- ü§ì Analogy: Branching in git can be thought of as parallel universes when making choices. Suppose you choose to study this git documentation, then the ideal path would be you completing this documentation. However, if you deviate from this behavior and decide to quit reading this documentation at this exact moment, you are creating a parallel universe in which you did not read the documentation. You can do different things in this parallel universe like meeting with a friend, have fun, etc, but it all started with you reading the documentation. The point where you quit reading the documentation is the point when two different branches were created: the one where you read the documentation, and one where you didn't. Branch 1 can be named as read-documentation / main, and Branch 2 can be named fun-implementation-in-life.

## Examples of real world use cases of creating branches for specific tasks:

- you can have specific environments: dev, test main:
  - this is the practice where you write code in the dev branch, test for bugs in the test branch, and release code that you will use to serve customers in main
- you can have branches to specific devs: prath, basch, ...
  - different people work on files at the same time
- you can have branches for features: redbull-wing-irl-implementation, etc:
  - a good practice is to create a new branch for each feature, and combine (merge) the changes to the main when you are done

## Most Important Git Branch Commands:

```bash
git branch # list all local branches

git branch branch-name # create a new branch under the name branch-name

git checkout branch-name # switch to the branch-name branch

git checkout -b branch-name # creating + switching to a branch branch-name

git branch -d branch-name # delete a branch

git branch -m old-branch-name new-branch-name # rename a branch locally

git branch -a # list all branches locally + REMOTE
```

## Remote Branch Syncing:

- when you create a branch locally and try to push, there is no such branch on remote yet (the branch is only on your local computer, not online)
- you would have to sync your branch to remote:

```
git push -u origin branchname
```

- -u is short for --set-upstream

## Visual Understanding of Git Branches

### 1. Basic Branch Concept

Think of branches as parallel timelines of your project:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Initial commit] --> B[Add README]
    B --> C[Setup project]
    C --> D[Fix typo]
    C --> E[Add login form]
    E --> F[Add validation]
    F --> G[Add styling]
    D --> H[Release v1.0]
    G --> H

    style C fill:#ffeb3b
    style H fill:#4caf50
```

**Key Visual Elements:**

- **Commits**: Each box represents a commit (snapshot of your code)
- **Branch Lines**: Different paths show different branches
- **Merge**: Where branches come back together (H)
- **Branch Point**: Where new branches split off (C)

### 2. Branch Creation and Switching

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Commit A] --> B[Commit B]
    B --> C[Commit C - Branch Point]
    C --> D[main: Fix typo]
    C --> E[feature-A: Add feature]
    E --> F[feature-A: Complete feature]
    C --> G[feature-B: Start work]
    G --> H[feature-B: Finish work]

    style C fill:#ffeb3b
    style D fill:#2196f3
    style F fill:#ff9800
    style H fill:#9c27b0
```

**What's happening here:**

- Commits A, B, C happen on `main` branch
- At commit C, we create two new branches
- Each branch continues with its own commits
- All branches share the common history up to point C

### 3. Understanding HEAD Pointer

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[main branch] --> B[Latest commit on main]
    C[feature-login branch] --> D[Latest commit on feature]
    E[HEAD pointer] --> F{Which branch are you on?}
    F --> A
    F --> C

    style E fill:#ff5722
    style F fill:#ffc107
```

**HEAD** is like a bookmark that shows:

- Which branch you're currently on
- Which commit you're looking at
- Where new commits will be added

### 4. Common Branching Workflows

#### Feature Branch Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Initial commit] --> B[main branch]
    B --> C[develop branch]
    C --> D[feature-auth branch]
    C --> E[feature-dashboard branch]
    D --> F[Add login]
    D --> G[Add logout]
    E --> H[Create dashboard]
    E --> I[Add widgets]
    G --> J[Merge to develop]
    I --> J
    J --> K[Merge to main]
    K --> L[Release v1.0]

    style A fill:#4caf50
    style C fill:#2196f3
    style D fill:#ff9800
    style E fill:#9c27b0
    style L fill:#4caf50
```

#### Hotfix Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[v1.0 Release] --> B[Feature work continues]
    A --> C[Critical bug found!]
    C --> D[Create hotfix branch]
    D --> E[Fix critical bug]
    E --> F[Merge back to main]
    F --> G[v1.0.1 Release]
    B --> H[Continue feature work]

    style A fill:#4caf50
    style C fill:#f44336
    style D fill:#ff9800
    style G fill:#4caf50
```

### 5. Git Workflow States

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Working Directory<br/>üìÅ Your files] --> B[Staging Area<br/>üìã Ready to commit]
    B --> C[Local Repository<br/>üíæ Committed]
    C --> D[Remote Repository<br/>‚òÅÔ∏è Pushed to GitHub]

    E[Modified files] --> A
    F[git add] --> B
    G[git commit] --> C
    H[git push] --> D

    style A fill:#e3f2fd
    style B fill:#fff3e0
    style C fill:#f3e5f5
    style D fill:#e8f5e8
```

### 6. Parallel Development Scenario

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Shared starting point] --> B[Alice starts feature A]
    A --> C[Bob starts feature B]
    A --> D[Main gets hotfix]

    B --> E[Alice: Add login form]
    E --> F[Alice: Add validation]

    C --> G[Bob: Create dashboard]
    G --> H[Bob: Add user stats]

    D --> I[Main: Fix security bug]

    F --> J[Merge Alice's work]
    H --> J
    I --> J
    J --> K[All work combined!]

    style A fill:#ffeb3b
    style B fill:#2196f3
    style C fill:#9c27b0
    style D fill:#f44336
    style K fill:#4caf50
```

### 7. Understanding Commit Relationships

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[abc123<br/>Parent commit] --> B[def456<br/>Child commit]
    B --> C[ghi789<br/>Regular commit]
    B --> D[mno345<br/>Branch commit]
    C --> E[jkl012<br/>Main continues]
    D --> F[pqr678<br/>Branch continues]

    G[Merge commit<br/>xyz999] --> C
    G --> F
    G --> H[Combined result]

    style A fill:#e3f2fd
    style G fill:#ff9800
    style H fill:#4caf50
```

**Commit Relationships:**

- **Parent**: The commit that came before (abc123 ‚Üí def456)
- **Child**: The commit that comes after
- **Merge Commit**: A commit with multiple parents (xyz999)
- **Commit Hash**: Unique identifier for each commit

### 8. Branch Protection and Development Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[üë®‚Äçüíª Developer] --> B[Create Feature Branch]
    B --> C[Write Code]
    C --> D[git add & git commit]
    D --> E[git push to remote]
    E --> F[Create Pull Request]
    F --> G{Code Review}
    G -->|‚úÖ Approved| H[Merge to Main]
    G -->|‚ùå Changes Needed| C
    H --> I[üóëÔ∏è Delete Feature Branch]
    H --> J[üöÄ Deploy to Production]

    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style F fill:#fff3e0
    style H fill:#e8f5e8
    style I fill:#ffebee
    style J fill:#e8f5e8
```

## Branch Command Visualization

### Creating and Switching Branches

```bash
# Current state: on main branch
git branch feature-xyz     # Creates new branch (still on main)
git checkout feature-xyz   # Switches to new branch
# OR combine both:
git checkout -b feature-xyz
```

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[main branch] --> B[Commit A]
    B --> C[Commit B]
    C --> D[üìç You are here]

    E[After: git checkout -b feature-xyz] --> F[New branch created]
    C --> G[feature-xyz branch]
    G --> H[üìç You are now here]

    style D fill:#2196f3
    style H fill:#ff9800
```

### Remote Branch Tracking

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[üíª Local Branch] --> B[git push -u origin branch-name]
    B --> C[‚òÅÔ∏è Remote Branch]
    C --> D[üîó Tracking Relationship]

    E[üë• Other Developer] --> F[git pull]
    F --> C
    F --> G[Gets your changes]

    style D fill:#4caf50
    style G fill:#e8f5e8
```

## Advanced Branch Concepts

### 9. Branch Naming Conventions

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[main] --> B[develop]
    B --> C[feature/user-authentication]
    B --> D[feature/payment-integration]
    B --> E[bugfix/login-error]
    A --> F[hotfix/security-patch]
    B --> G[release/v2.0.0]

    style A fill:#4caf50
    style B fill:#2196f3
    style C fill:#ff9800
    style D fill:#ff9800
    style E fill:#f44336
    style F fill:#e91e63
    style G fill:#9c27b0
```

**Common Naming Patterns:**

- `feature/` - New features
- `bugfix/` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/` - Critical fixes
- `release/` - Release preparation
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

### 10. Branch Lifecycle

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[üå± Create Branch] --> B[üíª Develop]
    B --> C[üîÑ Regular Commits]
    C --> D[üì§ Push to Remote]
    D --> E[üìã Create Pull Request]
    E --> F[üëÄ Code Review]
    F --> G{Review Result}
    G -->|‚úÖ| H[üîÄ Merge]
    G -->|‚ùå| I[üîß Address Feedback]
    I --> C
    H --> J[üßπ Cleanup]
    J --> K[üóëÔ∏è Delete Branch]

    style A fill:#4caf50
    style H fill:#2196f3
    style K fill:#f44336
```

## Pro Tips for Branch Visualization

1. **Use Git Graph Extension**: Visual representation in VS Code
2. **Command Line Tools**: `git log --oneline --graph --all`
3. **Think in Timelines**: Each branch is a separate timeline of changes
4. **Understand Pointers**: Branches are just pointers to commits
5. **HEAD Movement**: Track where you are in the commit history

### Visualization Commands

```bash
# See branch structure in terminal
git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate

# See all branches
git branch -a

# See branch relationships
git show-branch

# Visual diff between branches
git diff main..feature-branch
```
