## Welcome to Module 2:
- this section focuses on GitHub, how to work with it, and how to work with it efficiently
- The following documentation provides you insights as to what features there are available on GitHub, and you are recommended to explore on your own as you go on about this documentation
- At the end of the module, there is a bonus module that contains some prep material for the GitHub Foundations Certification (This certification is from Microsoft, and normally costs $100 but is free for college students to give, so take advantage of this opportunity)
	- Note that I have successfully passed my certification (~880/1000) from this documentation specifically + Andrew Brown's 10 hour video lecture on GitHub Foundations Certification (these notes are based on his lectures, available for free on youtube under the FreeCodeCamp channel). If you dedicate enough time (I passed my cert by preparing in a week, but majorly because I had been working with Git and GitHub for a couple months at this point. It could take you anywhere between 1 week and 2 weeks to prepare depending on your experience with GitHub and Git)
- okay peace out, read the rest of the thing if you wanna advance your open-source game
- NOTE: This module is not as polished as 01 - Git. This section is more raw and free-flowing, but should get the job done (If you are serious about the certification, follow Andrew Brown's video lecture, come back to these notes to revise)
