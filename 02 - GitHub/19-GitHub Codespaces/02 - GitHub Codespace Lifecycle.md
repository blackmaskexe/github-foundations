1. create a codespace / reopen
2. get the codespaces running
3. stop your codespace (freezes the state of your workspace so you can use it later)
4. codespaces time outs after 30 mins of inactivity (the same as a stop)
5. you can rebuild your codespaces after changing the devcontainer file
6. environment is saved periodically, therefore work will persist on vm as long as it's not deleted (to ensure saved work, you have to commit your work / have a temp branch that you push into)
7. autosave: automatically done in browser, manually in vscode desktop and autosave needs to be turned on
8. deleting (work will be deleted as well if not committed and pushed to repo)
