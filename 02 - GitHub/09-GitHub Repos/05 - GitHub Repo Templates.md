- it is a feature for repos that allow other GitHub users to make a copy of the contents of the template repo to use as the starting point of their own repo
- `Repo settings -> under repo name, check off/on template repository`
- users don't need to fork this, and their copy of the repo becomes their own because this is considered as a template
- this is a feature mostly useful for public repo, but for some reason it is also available for private repos
- you can create a new repo from the template repo using the "Use this template" button on the repo code tab
