## Changes that you can make:
1. change repo name (again, unique scoped to profile)
2. change name of the base branch (main is default, but not recommended to rename)
3. enable and disable features for your GitHub repo (Wiki, issues, etc)

## Danger Zone Changes that you can make:
1. change repo visibility:
	   - if you make repo from private to public, anyone can fork your repo, all rulesets disabled, yoru changes visible publically as activity

2. disable branch protection rules (make it so that you can directly push to main)
3. transfer ownership
4. archive repo (make the repo read only)
5. delete repo
